Details on the Feature Selection
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and Time_Gyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (Time_BodyAcc-XYZ and Time_GravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (Time_BodyAccJerk-XYZ and Time_BodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (Time_BodyAccMag, Time_GravityAccMag, Time_BodyAccJerkMag, Time_BodyGyroMag, Time_BodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing Freq_BodyAcc-XYZ, Freq_BodyAccJerk-XYZ, Freq_BodyGyro-XYZ, Freq_BodyAccJerkMag, Freq_BodyGyroMag, Freq_BodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
